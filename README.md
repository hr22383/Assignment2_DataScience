Dataset of Eye Tracking for Predicting Empathy Levels

This research investigates a dataset that uses eye tracking technology to detect the width of the eye pupil and predicts levels of empathy among people while performing a specific task. To predict empathy assessment, the dataset comprises variables based on pupil dilation, eye location, and gazing.

Investigation of Datasets
I first evaluate the dataset to see which factors are important in predicting empathy levels. I have divided the data into two half, datasets II and III, and perform the identical operation on both. I undertook descriptive analysis, data cleansing, and data processing using significant factor selection based on the greatest statistic value.

Prediction of Empathy Score
I have divided each dataset into training and testing halves and apply a k-mean model to predict empathy scores. I have examined people based on their empathy levels to see which variables are more important in predicting empathy assessment. We also look at the model's score to see how well it performs.

Findings
My findings reveal that the more severe the depressive symptoms, the less dilated the pupils become. This discovery can be used to assess people's empathy levels. 

Conclusion
Finally, this article shows how eye tracking data can be used to predict empathy levels. I hope that my findings will spur additional study in this area and help to build more precise and reliable approaches for predicting empathy assessment.
