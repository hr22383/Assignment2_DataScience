Dataset of Eye Tracking for Predicting Empathy Levels
This research investigates a dataset that uses eye tracking technology to detect the width of the eye pupil and predicts levels of empathy among people while performing a specific task. To predict empathy assessment, the dataset comprises variables based on pupil dilation, eye location, and gazing.

Investigation of Datasets
We first evaluate the dataset to see which factors are important in predicting empathy levels. We divide the data into two half, datasets II and III, and perform the identical operation on both. We undertake descriptive analysis, data cleansing, and data processing using significant factor selection based on the greatest statistic value.

Prediction of Empathy Score
We divide each dataset into training and testing halves and apply a k-mean model to predict empathy scores. We examine people based on their empathy levels to see which variables are more important in predicting empathy assessment. We also look at the model's score to see how well it performs.
Findings
My findings reveal that the more severe the depressive symptoms, the less dilated the pupils become. This discovery can be used to assess people's empathy levels. Our research sheds light on the use of eye tracking data to predict empathy assessment, which has applications in healthcare, education, and psychology.

Conclusion
Finally, this article shows how eye tracking data can be used to predict empathy levels. We hope that our findings will spur additional study in this area and help to build more precise and reliable approaches for predicting empathy assessment.
